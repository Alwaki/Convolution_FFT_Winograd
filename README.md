# Convolution with FFT and Winograd

This repository contains code for benchmarking convolutions with Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT) and Winograd methods. The project is part of a bachelor thesis on numerical methods for the course SA114X at KTH. It is fully written in Julia.

## Description

In progress

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

The project depends on the following Julia packages: FFTW, DSP, BenchmarkTools, Plots, LaTeXStrings, ProgressBars.

### Executing program

The program can be run by executing the main file from the src directory:

```
julia main.jl
```
