Project:        Convolutions with Naive, FFT and Winograd methods

Description:    This project intends to benchmark convolution
                with the FFT algorithm and Winograd method, as
                well as a naive baseline implementation. 
                The benchmarking is intended to investigate
                differences in benefits for different data 
                and filter sizes.
